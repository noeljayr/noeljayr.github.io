So we have planned it that it will have :-

Home page 
-this is where your org activities, objectives, a little background of the org and latest blog news will be displayed

Profile page
-where all organization information will be displayed including all members and their positions 

(and we were suggesting that we should have a membership form their so that people can easily join you org by simply signing a membership form online and then he/she will send membership fee manually)

Blog page 
-where all news will be displayed like the way kuwala is you have to write an article and attaching a photo or video to it just to show the viewers what your org does wherever charity work etc

Gallery page 
-this is where all your images like those that were sent to my inbox can be displayed just like a place where you can keep org memories that viewers can see

Partner's page(optimal)
-this is where all your partners details will be displayed (contact details logo, and a little description of how they have contributed to your org or what help they offered/they are offering to your org

Donation page
-This page will have your organization bank details e.g account number or if you we can just provide contact details where by can just contact you directly

So this is what we will start developing if their is somewhere, where it should be collected you can tell us
